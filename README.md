How to play the game:

1. Press start.

2. You start the game with a Central Command and 2 workers.  First, you should select a worker by left clicking it and then right click an iron ore field to start automatically mining resources. Your resource count is in the upper-left corner of the screen.

3. Select your Central Command (you can select any unit in the game by left clicking it.)  Either press "w" or click the pickaxe in the game interface in the upper-right to queue up a worker for creation. You can queue up to 6 workers in total, and you can cancel them at any time by either pressing "esc" when selecting the central command or left click on one of the workers in queue as displayed by the game interface.  Each worker costs 100 resources and will refund 100 on cancelation.  Note: When you cancel a worker, the production timer will restart.

4. You must build turrets to defend yourself from the numan onslaught.  Select a worker and press "b", then left click an open area in order to construct a turret (you can also use the game interface and select the build icon.)  This costs 100 resources.  Note: you cannot do this when under 100 resources, and if you go under 100 resources when the worker gets to its destination, the turret will not be constructed.

5. Select a turret.  You can upgrade attack or defense by clicking on the icons.  Upgrading attack costs 100 (+20 atk) and upgrading defense costs 40 (+100 health.)

6. You win if you can get to 2000 resources. (Enough to build a spaceship and blast off with the rest of the homo sapiens sapiens!)  You lose if your central command is destroyed.

Keys/Mouse input:

Selected Unit:

Worker - "b" to build (then left click somewhere), "g" to go (then left click somewhere), or click icons in game interface. Can also right click ore fields when selecting them to auto-mine that ore field.

Central Command - "w" to put worker in queue, "esc" to cancel one worker, or click icons in game interface

Turret - Click sword in game interface to upgrade attack damage, click shield to upgrade defensive stats (health.)  (Only upgrades that single turret.)

Cheat Keys: When in game, press the "\" key to give yourself 200 resource.  This is really the only
cheat key you need, because you can press it 10 times to win the game.  If the game is too hard, I would recommend just giving yourself ore and bulding around 10 turrets at the start of the game.

Known bugs:

Sometimes a turret will switch targets before the enemy is destroyed, even if the new target is further away.  Unsure why this happens.
